IRRI SNP-Seek database Automation pipeline using Python to download haplotypic information.

**Description:** The project is having four files (two .csv files, one python script file and a chrome version .exe file). This python script is made to ease the task to download hundreds/thousands of haplotypic information from IRRI-SNP-SEEK database for bioinformaticians, plant breeders, rice researchers and enthusiast.

**Problem Statement:** To download the repetitive genotypic/haplotypic information from IRRI-SNP-SEEK for some 1000's locus is time consuming and takes a week of time. This project objects to this job in 72 hours by using webdriver and selenium package of python.

Requirement: 
1. Install python for script execution.
2. Install .exe chrome webdriver (Link: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) - Download as per your chrome version.
